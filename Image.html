                <h3>State transition path digraph</h3>
                <p>Using these 16 states, we established a logic for state transitions. Individuals can transition from unborn to young, young to old, young to dead at a lower rate, and old to dead at a higher rate.
                Based on this logic, we created a directed graph representing transitions from the initial state (both individuals unborn) to the final state (both individuals dead).
                From this graph, we identified 126 paths from start to end, with states represented numerically: 0 for unborn, 1 for young, 2 for old, and 3 for deceased.</p>

                <h3>The number of paths in 13 Allen interval relationships</h3>
                <p>This chart shows the number of paths for each type of Allen interval relation in our model. The x-axis represents the number of paths, while the y-axis lists the different path types. Here's a summary of the key points:
                <ul>
                    <li>Contains and During each have 14 paths, indicating these relationships are fairly common in the modeled scenarios.</li>
                    <li>Finished by, Finishes, Started by, and Starts each have 10 paths.</li>
                    <li>Overlapped by and Overlaps have the highest number of paths, each with 18, showing these relations are the most frequent.</li>
                    <li>Met by and Meets have 4 paths each, indicating they are less common.</li>
                    <li>After and Before also have 4 paths each.</li>
                    <li>Equal has 6 paths, showing the occurrence of simultaneous events is moderate.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Probability distribution of different relations of 13 Allen intervals in four states</h3>
                <p>The model accurately reflected higher Death rates for older individuals, leading to higher frequencies of "Overlap" and "During" relations. It also accurately reflected gender-specific death rates, with lower death rates for females leading to higher probabilities of certain interval relations involving longer female lifespans.</p>
